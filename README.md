Cleopatra who ruled Egypt in the first centry BCE, is closer to us today, then the pharoahs who built the pyramids!

When Herodotus visited Egypt, the Egyptians already consider themselves ancient - they had their own archeologists!

## Art

* Doesn't change - it was supposed to last eternity and so Egyptian art through the ages remains fairly constant
* It is on the walls of tombs: So the gods know what the afterlife should be like - enjoy fishing for instance
* Art show the peoples' fears.

## Gods and Godesses (Pharaoh is Horus on Earth)
[Osiris myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth) Osiris is the first to rise from the dead.
![15 Major Ancient Egyptian Gods And Godesses](/images/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts-min.jpg)
* [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus)/Falcon on Earth (Narmar Pallet). Horus was the son of Osiris who revenged the death of Isis against Set. GOD-KING! (Plato: it is the best to have a philosopher king)
* July: The gods around Aswan turn the Nile river red (setiment) and then green (vegitation)
* [Anubis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis)/Jackel (jackels are always wondering around decaying meat) The god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.

### Myth of Osiris
* [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth)
* Born in Egypt - never conquer
* Must be whole - complete (first prostetic legs)
* Fit perfectly in coffin

### Horus vs Chaos (Climate)
Why Egypt viewed the world as so chaotic and climate was central to Egyptian culture
  * Unpredictableness of the Nile
  * Isolated by desert

Order (Ma'at), not Chaos was the will of the gods.

The living god was the early manifestation of **Horus**, a hawk, while **Seth** was the harbinger of Chaos.

Pharaohs needed to talk to the gods in order to keep **ma'at** (i.e., order).  There were man threats from flash floods (World's oldest dam at [Wadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadd_el-Kafara)), drought, sand, neighbors, and **death**.

## Nabta Playa, Calendars, and Papyrus and Lotus 

1. [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra) came out of the ocean of chaos on a **mound** (i.e., pyramids!) to give life and hope.  But every night Ra goes back into the chaos only to rise again - the hope of Egyptians to be swept into the cycle of eternal life!
1. **8000 BCE**: Sahara wasn't always aird and parched: [Nabta Playa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa#/media/File:Nabta-Egypt_NL.jpg). Because of the summer monsoon, oases would form, but still 3 days without rain and the lake would dry up.
1. **5500-5000 BCE**: First ever calendar is created in the desert to predict the beginning of summer and the rainy season! 2000 years before Stonehenge (3100 BC).
1. **5000 BCE**: People of the desert migrated to Nile as oases like Nabta Playa dried up.  The Nile Was a blessing and curse: floods and droughts.  Egyptians created the calendar we used to day: with 4 seasons!  **But** they used it to watch the Nile not the weather.
1. **4000 BCE**: as the people from the oases such as Nabta Playa finally settle, the beginnings of civilization appear: pottery, drawings et cetera.
1. **4000-3000 BCE**: two kingdoms appear: Papyrus Plant (Lower Egypt - the delta) and Lotus (Upper Egypt - "start" of the Nile)
1. **3500-3200 BCE**: 2 Kingdoms:
  1. The first city of Egypt: **Hierakonpolis** - city of the Hawk (i.e., **[Nekhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhen))** on the Nile and one of the most important.
  1. The kingdom of Lower Egypt: **[Buto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buto)**.  Residents were less sophisticated.  This is demonstrated by the kilns and pottery.
1. **3200 BCE**: Hieroglyphics. Sumarian writing only had counting, at this time Egyptians had more complex writings.
1. **3100 BCE**: The first pharaoh, **[King Narmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer)** -  began unifying Lower and Upper Egypt: the founder of the first dynasty; believed to be the same person as Menes. Pharaohs of the first dynasty were buried in [Abydos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt).  The capital was [Thinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinis).
1. **3100 BCE**: King Narmer Founding of Memphis for a new capital. Memphis comes from [Menes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes) which is where the name Egypt comes from.

## Pharaoh's Quest for Eternity
* Is it possible that the crown is passed from pharaoh to pharaoh - not found
* Pyramds are the vehicle to resurrection and immortality.
* Pyramids of Giza are not the only pyramids.  Pyramids dot the Nile river all the way down to [Aswan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan).

[List of Pharaohs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs)

### Early Dynastic Period

#### 1st Dynasty
* **3100 BCE** King Narmer & [Narmer Palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette) - first historical document in the world - In Cairo Museum - and carved by 2 different people. Palette was likely a cosmetic palette to anoint god. Narmer Palette displays art that will the consistent throughout history. Smitting is in this pallete for centuries (i.e., **Ramesses II** **smiting** a Nubian:
![Ramesses-II-smiting-nubian](/images/Ramesses-II-smiting-nubian.jpg)
Narmar Palette lays the foundation for a god-king; i.e., a pharaoh.

#### 2nd Dynasty (Walls, Tombs, and Mastabas)
1. **2780 BCE** King Khasekhemwy. Last king of the 2nd dynasty and known for the [Tomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html) of [Khasekhemwy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khasekhemwy) buried near **Abydos**.  He undertook considerable building projects upon the reunification of Egypt after a period of trouble. [Built buildings out of **brick**! Recessed walls make it look beautiful with the sun moving across the sky](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html)!

### Old Kingdom

#### 3rd Dynasty (Step Pyramids)
1. 2500 BCE the great enclosure near the pyramid of Djoser - just huge! And predates Djoser by 25 years!  Oldest monumental structure created entirley of stone.
1. **2667–2648 BC**: The [Pyramid of Djoser (Imhotep)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser)) - [Step Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_pyramid) for King Djoser at Saqqara - 141 ft. Djoser buried Khasekhemwy!  Djoser was Khasekhemwy's step-son.  Djoser combined the tomb/enclosure walls of Khasekhemwy but made the **mastabas** higher and higher to be visible: The step pyramid. A staircase to heaven: Commissioned the first Pyramid in Egypt.
1. Following Pharaoh had an unfinished tomb, but it was decoy.
1. **2637–2613 BCE** Pharaoh Huni the False Pyramid. The first and last step pyramid after Djoser. - 213 (ruined) - 301 ft tall. Built by last Pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty: Huni.  But Sneferu was behind the idea.

#### 4th Dynasty (Traditional Pyramids)
1. **2600 BC** [Sneferu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneferu) - Egypt's greatest pyramid builder & was the founding monarch of the 4th dynasty. Inovator & and the circle! Build monements after Djoser in Dahshur.
  * [Hetepheres I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetepheres_I) was wife of Sneferu and mother of [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu).
  * [Meidum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meidum) Pyramid - more of a tower then pyramid.  In the city of Meidum
  * The [Bent Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Pyramid).  Would have been taller than pyramids of Giza.  The bent pryamid was built on sandy ground and began to crack - it had to be abandoned.
  * **2600+ BCE** [Red Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pyramid): 45 degrees - the same as the Bent Pyramid's bent part - (344 ft). Rooms inside resemble a double pyramid to support - increase changes to go to haven. 17 years from the bricks!
1. **2580–2560 BCE** [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu) [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza) - 455 ft.  During **Inundation** - the flooding is when the farmers worked on the pyramids.
1. **2570 BCE** [Pyramid of Khafre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Khafre) (2 feet smaller and better preserved) - causeway to the Nile: the **Sphix**. A bit of limestone is still at the top.
1. Menkaure: 3rd and smallest pyramid.
1. Shepseskaf: moves awyay from the Giza plateau.  Goes back to Saqqara and builds a mastaba: Owner of the Mastabat el-Fara'un.

Forgotten Pyramids

#### 5th Dynasty (`-Re`; Time not so kind to these pyramids - Sun king and Userkaf!)
1. [Westcar_Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westcar_Papyrus) tells the story of the beginning of dynasty 5.  Magician talks about the birth of the dynasty. **Solar kings - solar temple!**
1. [Sun Temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple)
1. **2498–2491 BCE**: [Userkaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userkaf). Built the "Heap of Stone" pyramid at [Saqqara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Userkaf). First Solar pyramid.
1. The rest of these pharaohs incorportate 'Re' into them (i.e., Sahure, Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre)
1. [Neferefre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neferefre): incomplete pyramid but a vast amount of 5th dynasty items. If tomb found, he would be the oldest intact mummy ever found.  Details records of 200 years of the king's cult festivals and honoring rituals
1. **2360 BCE**: [Unas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unas). The last of pharaohs in the 5th Dynasty [Pyramid of Unas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Unas) - Originally reaching 141 ft - now it is ruined. Pyramid Texts! So artistic and spells. They describe priests coming to power!
![PyramidTexts](/images/PyramidTexts.jpg)

-- Pyramids went underground except for the Kingdom of Kush in modern day Sudan. Egypt coveted the wealth of **Nubia** 1400 BCE -- [Jebel Barkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal)

#### 6th Dynasty (Teti & Mereruka; 2345 to 2181 BC)
1. Small affairs, nothing crazy. Small pyramids.
1. First ruler: [Teti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teti) and noble around it is beautiful!
  * [Mereruka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereruka) was one of Egypt's most powerful officials at a time when the influence of local state noblemen was increasing in wealth and power. The mastaba of Mereruka is the largest and most elaborate of all the non-royal tombs in Saqqara with 33 rooms or chambers in total.
1. Last/nearly last rule: [Pepi II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepi_II_Neferkare): Possibly the longest reigning monarch of human history with 94 years on the throne. Alternatively, may have reigned "only" 64 years. Lived to be 98!
  * Maybe he lived too long or they stopped building pyramids (that is what maybe pries said): Leading to first Intermediate period.

### First Intermediate Period (2181–2060 BC)

#### 11th Dynasty (`-Intef`)
* Thebian monarchs trying to gain power & trying to **unify** upper and lower.
* Sehertawy Intef I was the first.  Thought of himself as a unifying ruler and king of upper and lower, but not really.
* Wahankh Intef II was the second and conquered Abydos and its nome.  He loved **dogs**.
* Nakhtnebtepnefer. `-Nefer` means **beautiful**.  Think of [Nefertari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertari). Nakhtnebtepnefer is **actually** fighting and unifying.

### Middle Kingdom (11th & 12th Dynasty & Deir el-Bahari)

#### 11th Dynasty (`-Mentu` & `-Hotep`) Continued...
* `-Mentu` (God of War) & `-Hotep` (to be pleased). This family knows you have to be tough to unify (**Amunhotep**: `Amun` is `pleased`)
* The scultpures/artists at this time had lost their skills becuase of the 1st Intermediate Period, but the `-Menut` are pulling it together.
* [Mentuhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II): **Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II** unified all Egypt c. 2015 BC, Middle Kingdom begins. 2060–2010 BC. Temple is at [Deir el-Bahari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Bahari) (the first there; later Hatshepsut’s Temple is built there).  Tomb is nice, but the artists have to get their skills back.
* Simple coffin - wooden box - **BUT** with spells.  The priests are so much more powerful - remember Unas w/ the Pyramid Texts.  After the raidings of pyramids, the common person now wants coffin texts b/c they don't have pyramids. The body shaped coffin is of the New Kingdom.
* In 1911 [Winlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Eustis_Winlock)  began excavating the mortuary complex of the 11th Dynasty pharaoh Mentuhotep II (2010–1998 B.C.) at Deir el-Bahri in the Valley of the Kings, where he discovered the bodies of 60 soldiers slain in battle and buried in linen shrouds decorated with the cartouche of Pharaoh [Mentuhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II). On March 17, 1920 Winlock discovered the tomb of Mentuhotep II's prime minister [Meketre](https://www.metmuseum.org/met-around-the-world/?page=10157), which contains a model bakery-brewery.  There is a shoulder in the NYC Metropolitan of art. At this time lots of the material was sent back to Metropolitan Museum of Art.

#### 12th Dynasty (1991 to 1802 BC)

* [Amenemhet I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenemhat_I) I: probably a viceroy. However, produces a legend on a papyrus. And we will have a **rebirth**. Moves the capital to show Egypt is unified.  New survey the land b/c of the inundation!  People have land!  Good old days and now he has a [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Amenemhet_I).  He is likely murdered, but he was prepared because he had his son become co-regent. Leaves note that gives advice to son to be cautious. This family used media well in order to say about how is father was "almost killed".  Could be murdered b/c he was God.
![AmenemhetIPyramid](/images/AmenemhetIPyramid.jpg)

* [Senusret I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusret_I) son of Amenemhet. He builds forts to mind gold. He goes beyond Aswan where the boulders are build huge forts. [Buhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buhen) & [Semna (Nubia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semna_(Nubia)) made of wood and mud.  He also took son as co-regent.
![Buhen](/images/Buhen3.jpg)
![Semna](/images/Semna-vue.jpg)

Then Amenemhet II (goes to Punt), Senusret II

[Senusret III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusret_III): **Art changes!** Eyes are drooping and looks **tried**; builds pyramid near Dashur (i.e., [Sneferu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneferu)).
![Senusret III](/images/SenusretIII.jpg)

[Amenemhet III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenemhat_III): Looks like father and tired. 2 Pyramids, one again at near Dashur. He changes his entrance likely b/c of tomb robbing - nearly worked. [Flinders Petrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Petrie) couldn't find the entrance - went from top down.
![Amenemhet III](/images/AmenemhetIII.jpg)

Amenemhet IV & then Queen - troubled times ahead...Hyksos!

### Second Intermediate Period (Hyksos & Joseph; 1802–1550 BC)

* 13th and 14th both ruling at the same time.

#### 13th Dynasty (1802 to around 1649 BC)

* Not a complete disaster, but the begining of the end. For example, they build pyramids at Dashur and Saqqara.

#### 14th Dynasty

* Ruling from the **delta**! Good for military advantage. Hard to excavate there.

#### 15th Dynasty

High tide of the [Hyksos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyksos) ruler. People from the fertile crescent who are semites. Joseph from the bible - a dream interpreter. Interpreting dreams is popular in Egyptian society at the time.  Capital is at [Avaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaris) in the Delta and worshiped Seth.

#### 16th Dynasty

* Not too much here.

#### 17th Dynasty: Expulsion of the Hyksos (1650 to 1550 BC)

* [Kamose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamose) (1554–1549 BC): takes over and does a number on them, but doesn't provide the last blow.
* [Ahmose I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmose_I) finally drove the Hyksos out.
* This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and finally Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.

### New Kingdom (i.e., Age of Gold)

#### 18th Dynasty (Thebes [Karnak Temple] - Pyramid-shaped mountain - Valley of the Kings)

1. **1557** [Ahmose I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmose_I) is from the 17th dynasty but then kicks out the Hyksos starts the 18th Dynasty. Military man and sets the tone.

1. **1541–1520** [Amenhotep I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_I). His name is Ahunhoptem: `-Amun` - "To please the God `Amun`" (`Amun` is the main god of Thebes). **Honors Seqenenre's mother and wife!** HUGE! He is setting a tradition of Queens. Gives his **wife** a title of **The God's Wife**. He also goes to Nubia to conquer their well known **archers** and decimated them. **Separates** his tomb and mortuary (offerings) temple.  He doesn't want people who come to see his tomb.  So go to my temple, bot tomb. Left no sons.

--> Valley of the Kings -->

1. **1520–1492 BCE** [Thutmose I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_I). `Thut` is the God of Writing & `Moses` is born so it means The God of Writing is born. Note: `Moses` is an Egyptian name! He married the right woman - married the daughter of Ahmose. Went further down the Nile pass the cateracs (4th caterack) - the rocks! So hard for them to navigate and they are so bad in the water that they usually go at night in May or June when it is low and at night in full moon.  He expanded Egypt's territorial extent during his reign by conquering Nubia and the "sand dwellers".  He also goes north into Iraq.  **First** king to be burried in the **Valley of the Kings**.  His tomb was designed by architect [Ineni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineni) - no one see or hear. West valley and where he didn't think people would visit or settle; and one entrance to the valley. Also erects largest obelisks at Karnak Temple. His daughter is **[Hatshepsut](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut)** the only royal one left when Thutmose I dies! First tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

1. **1492–1479** [Thutmose II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_II) Son of Thutmose I is a half-brother of Hatshepsut. Grandson of Amenhotep I through his mother, Mutnofret. He becomes pharaoh by marrying Hatshepsut - "long" marriage.

* **1479–1458** [Queen Hatshepsut](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut). Temple @ [Deir_el-Bahari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Bahari).  Step-son and nephew was [Thutmose III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III), but he was too young so she took over.  Builds temple @ [Deir el-Bahari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Bahari). She does this b/c [Mentuhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II) built his temple here and hew as the great unifier of Egypt after the first Intermediate Period. The hieroglyphic describe that later she declared herself king. However, her name was carved out by [Thutmose III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III). The walls depict: traveling to Punt. Thebes to Red Sea to the south to bring back giraffes. The walls depict first accurate images of sub-sahara Africa; and bringing back Frankensense and Mur PLANTS.  The walls describe her devine birth: The God Amun (i.e., the hidden one) disguised as her father, Thutmose I, visits her mother and the result is that her mother becomes pregnant. **tallest obelisk** is in Thebes at Karnak Temple.

1. **1500 BCE** [Thutmose III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III) - greatest military leader. Thutmose II has a son with a different mother: [Thutmose III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III) and decides to have him marry Hatshepsut - his **step-mom** & **aunt**. Son of Thutmose II. May have ruled jointly with Hatshepsut, his aunt and step-mother, during the early part of her reign. Famous for his territorial expansion into Levant and Nubia (west Nile) and the Kingdom of Kush (East Nile - the gate keepers to the heart of Africa. Under his reign, the Ancient Egyptian Empire was at its greatest extent. Ruled during the height of Egypt's Power. Late in his reign, he obliterated Hatshepsut's name and image from temples and monuments. Had a lover name Sentma (sp?) overseer of palace and works and lots of land and has $. This relationship is documented in poronographic graffiti. His tomb was a real sarcophogus with pink granite from Aswan.  **Astronomical** ceiling. He is off training with military when young as Hatshepsut rules. In year 2 of his rule he goes Megia (i.e., Syria) and he goes **through** the valley. Typically this is a problem, but Thutmose III said I am going and you can follow. The army waiting doesn't expect that! However, b/c the Egyptians plundered fallen soldiers they didn't attack the retreating army and had to seige the city. Next 18 years he marchers there every year. His tomb in the Valley of the Kings - shaped in circle **also** has stick figures that look like book of the dead on papyrus **and** hard to get into in ancient times.

1. **1425–1400** [Amenhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_II) (military guy - **KV35**);

1. **1400–1390** [Thutmose IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_IV): As a dream between the paws of the spinx and has a vision that he is pharaoh.  Singleton obelisk.  It is Rome.

1. **1390–1352** [Amenhotep III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenhotep_III): "`Amun` is pleased". Thebese is still the religious capital. God `Amun` lives in Thebese. Great temples here. Father of Akhenaten and grandfather of [Tutankhamun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun). Ruled Egypt at the height of its power. Built many temples and monuments, including his enormous [Mortuary Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortuary_Temple_of_Amenhotep_III). Was the son of Thutmose IV.  Builds Queen Tie (a "commoner") a mile long lake at their home in Thebes - you can sail your boat, but the name of the boat is `-Akhen` - sundisk god. Builds Luxor temple - that sky line is because of Amenhotep III. He takes another name - the **Dazzling Sundisk of All Lands**. He **also** moves to Thebes later on. Typically pharaohs would live in Memphis. His mortuary temple is covered in water, ecept for the front - 2 HUGE statues. He is also buried in a far away place in the west of the Valley of the Kings. TEETH were horrible and had to take his young son as co-regent.

1. Heretic Pharaoh: [Amenhotep IV -> Akhenaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten). Changes military, religion, pharaoh. Comes to power b/c father is so sick (teeth). Finishes father's temple and takes wife [Nefertiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti).  Takes **nem** name to "Benefitial to the `Akhen`".  Shown with long face, hips, breasts.  Kids <3 expressing themselves in the Cairo museum here.  Only one god, the `Atun`/`Aten` Builds **strange templs** at Karnak. Show that he is celebrating the [Heb-sed festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed_festival) but ONLY the sun god. Many of his temples were taken down for other temples. In [Nefertiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti)'s temple it shows **she** is making offerings to the God.  Women are increasing in power - another change. Other temples are now closing - not important. Moved Thebes to holy city in the desert 200 miles north (Bringham Young) - probably forced out of Thebes by the priests. Vision to move there about the sun and mountains.

1. **1332–1324** [King Tutankhaten -> Tutankhamun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun) Commonly believed to be the son of Akhenaten, most likely reinstated the polytheistic Ancient Egyptian religion. His name change from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun reflects the change in religion from the Monotheistic Atenism to the classic religion, of which Amun is a major deity. He is thought to have taken the throne at around age eight or nine and to have died around age eighteen or nineteen, giving him the nickname "The Boy King." [Ay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ay) tells Tut to change his name and move back to Thebes. Fetuses were found in tomb. **Restoring & complete Amenhotep III Luxor temple**.

1. **1324–1320** [Ay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ay) Vizier of Tut and marries Tut's widow. Puts his tomb far off where Amenhotep III was buried to show Tut was a traditionalist - it was a going to be King Tut's tomb! His decorations are very close looking to Tut - trying to align himself with King Tut.

1. **1320–1292** [Horemheb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horemheb). Career military guy. Opposite of pacifist Akhenaten. Obliterated Images of the Amarna Pharaohs and **destroyed** and **vandalized** buildings and monuments associated with the [Amarna Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarna_Period).  Even the list of kings skips over the Amarna Kings. Integrates priests into army. Also builds a large pilon at Karnak to tell his great story and builds it out of Akhenaten's temples where Akhenaten is worshiping the sun god. Built a commoner's tomb in Saqqara where nobility at this time were burried - . His goal is to now be buried in the Valley of the Kings.

#### 19th Dynasty (Ramses the Great/Exodus)

1. **1292–1290** [Ramesses I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_I) He has a **son** and **grandson** (See above ^). Friends of [Horemheb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horemheb).

1. **1290–1279** [Seti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seti_I) - strange name because it comes from Set. Father of Ramesses the Great. Goes and conquers Kadesh (i.e., Syria). He is best know for adding the [Great Hypostyle Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hypostyle_Hall) to the [Precinct of Amun-Re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precinct_of_Amun-Re) at [Karnak Temple Complex/Karnataka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnak). Used to be painted and beautiful. This shows he is a traditionalist. Then he builds a [temple at Abydos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt#Temple_of_Seti_I) (where Osiris was buried) - this says it all!  He is saying "back to the good old days!"

![Seti I Template @ Abydos](/images/SetiIAbydos.jpg)

Maybe the most beautiful temple in Egypt because the artists during Akhenaten's reign had freedom and they are still alive to apply to the history.  Behind it is a very strange temple: [The Osireion[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osireion). Built to honor Osiris:

![Osirieon](/images/Osirieon.jpg)

This temple was likely not built by Seti I.  Instead he discovers it and carves his name on it. The stones are out of time period - they look more like the architecture of the time period of Khafre as can be seen in the [Valley Temple of Khafre.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khafra#Valley_Temple).

1. [Jebel Barkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal) rock formation had a strange additional rock formation that looked like the cobra and white crown/hat of the south that Egyptian's ware. Kushite rulers became pharoahs. Create 200 pyramids - more than in all of Egypt. Smaller and steeper wuht flat tops. [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB)

1. **1327 BCE** Death of Tutankhamun. The mask that covers his face is considered the most beautiful works of art ever crafted in gold.

## Manetho

Manetho was an Egyptian chronologist.  Came up with 30 dynasties

1. Earliest known temple in is in 
1. Spirits of the dead ruled before.
1. King Menes - found Egypts first dynasty (3100 BCE) (carried off by a Hipo - WTF?)
