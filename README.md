# Egypt

Cleopatra who ruled Egypt in the first centry BCE, is closer to us today, then the pharoahs who built the pyramids!

When Herodotus visited Egypt, the Egyptians already consider themselves ancient - they had their own archeologists!

## Gods and Godesses
Lecture Chapter 3

### Myth of Osiris
* Born in Egypt - never conquer
* Must be whole - complete (first prostetic legs)
* Fit perfectly in coffin

### Horus vs Chaos (Climate)
Why Egypt viewed the world as so chaotic and climate was central to Egyptian culture
  * Unpredictableness of the Nile
  * Isolated by desert

Order (Ma'at), not Chaos was the will of the gods.

The living god was the early manifestation of **Horus**, a hawk, while **Seth** was the harbinger of Chaos.

Pharaohs needed to talk to the gods in order to keep **ma'at** (i.e., order).  There were man threats from flash floods (World's oldest dam at [Wadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadd_el-Kafara)), drought, sand, neighbors, and **death**.

## Nabta Playa, Calendars, and Papyrus and Lotus 

1. [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra) came out of the ocean of chaos on a **mound** (i.e., pyramids!) to give life and hope.  But every night Ra goes back into the chaos only to rise again - the hope of Egyptians to be swept into the cycle of eternal life!
1. **8000 BCE**: Sahara wasn't always aird and parched: [Nabta Playa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa#/media/File:Nabta-Egypt_NL.jpg). Because of the summer monsoon, oases would form, but still 3 days without rain and the lake would dry up.
1. **5500-5000 BCE**: First ever calendar is created in the desert to predict the beginning of summer and the rainy season! 2000 years before Stonehenge (3100 BC).
1. **5000 BCE**: People of the desert migrated to Nile as oases like Nabta Playa dried up.  The Nile Was a blessing and curse: floods and droughts.  Egyptians created the calendar we used to day: with 4 seasons!  **But** they used it to watch the Nile not the weather.
1. **4000 BCE**: as the people from the oases such as Nabta Playa finally settle, the beginnings of civilization appear: pottery, drawings et cetera.
1. **4000-3000 BCE**: two kingdoms appear: Papyrus Plant (Lower Egypt - the delta) and Lotus (Upper Egypt - "start" of the Nile)
1. **3500-3200 BCE**: 2 Kingdoms:
  1. The first city of Egypt: **Hierakonpolis** - city of the Hawk (i.e., **[Nekhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhen))** on the Nile and one of the most important.
  1. The kingdom of Lower Egypt: **[Buto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buto)**.  Residents were less sophisticated.  This is demonstrated by the kilns and pottery.
1. **3200 BCE**: Hieroglyphics. Sumarian writing only had counting, at this time Egyptians had more complex writings.
1. **3100 BCE**: The first pharaoh, **[King Narmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer)** -  began unifying Lower and Upper Egypt: the founder of the first dynasty; believed to be the same person as Menes. Pharaohs of the first dynasty were buried in [Abydos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt).  The capital was [Thinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinis).
1. **3100 BCE**: King Narmer Founding of Memphis for a new capital. Memphis comes from [Menes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes).

## Pharaoh's Quest for Eternity
* Is it possible that the crown is passed from pharaoh to pharaoh - not found
* Pyramds are the vehicle to resurrection and immortality.
* Pyramids of Giza are not the only pyramids.  Pyramids dot the Nile river all the way down to [Aswan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan).

### Early Dynastic Period

#### 1st Dynasty
* **3100 BCE** King Narmer & [Narmer Palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette) - first historical document in the world - In Cairo Museum. Palette was likely a cosmetic palette to anoint god. Narmer Palette displays art that will the consistent throughout history. Smitting is in this pallete for centuries (i.e., **Ramesses II** **smiting** a Nubian:
![Ramesses-II-smiting-nubian](/images/Ramesses-II-smiting-nubian.jpg)

#### 2nd Dynasty (Walls, Tombs, and Mastabas)

He undertook considerable building projects upon the reunification of Egypt after a period of trouble. [Built buildings out of **brick**! Recessed walls make it look beautiful with the sun moving across the sky](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html)!

#### 3rd Dynasty (Step Pyramids)
1. 2500 BCE the great enclosure near the pyramid of Djoser - just huge! And predates Djoser by 25 years!  Oldest monumental structure created entirley of stone.
1. **2667–2648 BC**: The [Pyramid of Djoser]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser)) - [Step Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_pyramid) for King Djoser at Saqqara - 141 ft. Djoser buried Khasekhemwy!  Djoser was Khasekhemwy's step-son.  Djoser combined the tomb/enclosure walls of Khasekhemwy but made the **mastabas** higher and higher to be visible: The step pyramid. A staircase to heaven: Commissioned the first Pyramid in Egypt.
1. **2637–2613 BCE** Pharaoh Huni & [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meidum) - the False Pyramid. The first and last step pyramid after Djoser. - 213 (ruined) - 301 ft tall. Built by last Pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty: Huni.  But Sneferu was behind the idea.

#### 4th Dynasty (Traditional Pyramids)
1. **2600 BC** [Sneferu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneferu) - Egypt's greatest pyramid builder. Build monements after Djoser in Dahshur.  The [Bent Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Pyramid).  Would have been taller than pyramids of Giza.  The bent pryamid was built on sandy ground and began to crack - it had to be abandoned.
1. **2600+ BCE** [Red Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pyramid): 45 degrees - the same as the Bent Pyramid's bent part - (344 ft). Rooms inside resemble a double pyramid to support - increase changes to go to haven. 17 years from the bricks!
1. **2580–2560 BCE** [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu) [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza) - 455 ft

1. Menkaure

Forgotten Pyramids

#### 5th Dynasty (Time not so kind to these pyramids)
1. [Neferefre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neferefre): incomplete pyramid but a vast amount of 5th dynasty items. If tomb found, he would be the oldest intact mummy ever found.  Details records of 200 years of the king's cult festivals and honoring rituals
1. **2498–2491 BCE**: [Userkaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userkaf). Built the "Heap of Stone" pyramid at [Saqqara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Userkaf).

-- Pyramids went underground except for the Kingdom of Kush in modern day Sudan. Egypt coveted the wealth of **Nubia** 1400 BCE -- [Jebel Barkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal)

#### 18th Dynasty (Thebes - Pyramid-shaped mountain - Valley of the Kings)
1. **1500 BCE** [Thutmose_I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_I) designed by architect [Ineni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineni)

1. [Jebel Barkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal) rock formation had a strange additional rock formation that looked like the cobra and white crown/hat of the south that Egyptian's ware. Kushite rulers became pharoahs. Create 200 pyramids - more than in all of Egypt.  Smaller and steeper wuht flat tops. [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB)

## Age of Gold
1. **1327 BCE** Death of Tutankhamun.  The mask that covers his face is considered the most beautiful works of art ever crafted in gold.

## Manetho

1. Earliest known temple in is in 
1. Spirits of the dead ruled before.
1. King Menes - found Egypts first dynasty (3100 BCE) (carried off by a Hipo - WTF?)
