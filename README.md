Cleopatra who ruled Egypt in the first centry BCE, is closer to us today, then the pharoahs who built the pyramids!

When Herodotus visited Egypt, the Egyptians already consider themselves ancient.

## General Background

Centuries before Europe, Greece, Rome, and the Assyrian Empire begin Egypt is building the pramids of Giza (i.e., the Great Pyramid of Giz) between 2560–2540 BC.

* Nothern Europe: still in the stone age (ended between 8700 - 2000 BCE)
* Greece:
  * Archaic Greece (800 BC – 480 BC) 
  * Classical Greece (480 BC – 323 BC) - Herodotus visits Egypt and describes it's geography, people, and recounts a few semi-mythical stories.
  * Hellenistic Greece (323 BC – 146 BC)
* Rome: Founding of Rome 753 BC
* Assyrian 2500 - 609 BC

## Horus vs Chaos (Climate)

Becuase of the unpredictableness of the Nile and isolated by desert, climate was central to Egyptian culture

Order, not Chaos was the will of the gods.

The living god was the early manifestation of **Horus**, a hawk, while **Seth** was the harbinger of Chaos.

Pharaohs needed to talk to the gods in order to keep **ma'at** (i.e., order).  There were man threats from flash floods (World's oldest dam at [Wadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadd_el-Kafara)), drought, sand, neighbors, and **death**.

## Nabta Playa, Calendars, and Papyrus and Lotus 

1. [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra) came out of the ocean of chaos on a **mound** (i.e., pyramids!) to give life and hope.  But every night Ra goes back into the chaos only to rise again - the hope of Egyptians to be swept into the cycle of eternal life!
1. **8000 BCE**: Sahara wasn't always aird and parched: [Nabta Playa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa#/media/File:Nabta-Egypt_NL.jpg). Because of the summer monsoon, oases would form, but still 3 days without rain and the lake would dry up.
1. **5500-5000 BCE**: First ever calendar is created in the desert to predict the beginning of summer and the rainy season! 2000 years before Stonehenge (3100 BC).
1. **5000 BCE**: People of the desert migrated to Nile as oases like Nabta Playa dried up.  The Nile Was a blessing and curse: floods and droughts.  Egyptians created the calendar we used to day: with 4 seasons!  **But** they used it to watch the Nile not the weather.
1. **4000 BCE**: as the people from the oases such as Nabta Playa finally settle, the beginnings of civilization appear: pottery, drawings et cetera.
1. **4000-3000 BCE**: two kingdoms appear: Papyrus Plant (Lower Egypt - the delta) and Lotus (Upper Egypt - "start" of the Nile)
1. **3500-3200 BCE**: 2 Kingdoms:
  1. The first city of Egypt: **Hierakonpolis** - city of the Hawk (i.e., **[Nekhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhen))** on the Nile and one of the most important.
  1. The kingdom of Lower Egypt: **[Buto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buto)**.  Residents were less sophisticated.  This is demonstrated by the kilns and pottery.
1. **3200 BCE**: Hieroglyphics. Sumarian writing only had counting, at this time Egyptians had more complex writings.
1. **3100 BCE**: The first pharaoh, **[King Narmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer)**, began unifying Lower and Upper Egypt: the founder of the first dynasty. Pharaohs of the first dynasty were buried in [Abydos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt).  The capital was [Thinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinis).
1. **3100 BCE**: King Narmer Founding of Memphis for a new capital. Memphis comes from [Menes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes).

## Pharaoh's Quest for Eternity

* Egypt's first pyramid [The Pyramid of Unas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Unas) - virtual guide to immortality: spells and formulas.  Example: a soul full of sin won't make!
* Pyramid of Unas was first talk structure built in stone.
* Pyramds are the vehicle to resurrection and immortality.
* Pyramids of Giza are not the only pyramids.  Pyramids dot the Nile river all the way down to [Aswan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan).

### 2nd Dynasty
1. **2780 BCE** [Tomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html) of [Khasekhemwy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khasekhemwy) buried near **Abydos**.  He undertook considerable building projects upon the reunification of Egypt. [Built buildings out of **brick**! Recessed walls make it look beautiful with the sun moving across the sky](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html)!

### 3rd Dynasty
1. 2500 BCE the great enclosure near the pyramid of Djoser - just huge! And predates Djoser by 25 years!  Oldest monumental structure created entirley of stone.
1. **2667–2648 BC**: The [Pyramid of Djoser]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser)) [Step Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_pyramid) for King Djoser at Saqqara - 141 ft
1. Djoser buried Khasekhemwy!  Djosre was Khasekhemwy's step-son.  Djoser combined the tomb/enclosure walls of Khasekhemwy but made the mound high and higher to be visible: The step pyramid. A staircase to heaven

1. [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meidum) - the False Pyramid. The first and last step pyramid after Djoser. - 213 (ruined) - 301 ft tall. Built by last Pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty: Huni.

### 4th Dynasty

1. **2600 BC** [Sneferu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneferu) build monements after Djoser in Dahshur.  The [Bent Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Pyramid).  Would have been taller than pyramids of Giza.  The bent pryamid was built on sandy ground and began to crack - it had to be abandoned.
1. **2600+ BCE** [Red Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pyramid): 45 degrees - the same as the Bent Pyramid's bent part - (344 ft). Rooms inside resemble a double pyramid to support - increase changes to go to haven.
1. **2360 BCE**: [Pyramid of Unas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Unas) - 203 ft
1. **2580–2560 BCE** [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza) - 455 ft
