# Egypt

Cleopatra who ruled Egypt in the first centry BCE, is closer to us today, then the pharoahs who built the pyramids!

When Herodotus visited Egypt, the Egyptians already consider themselves ancient.

## General Background

Centuries before Europe, Greece, Rome, and the Assyrian Empire begin Egypt is building the pramids of Giza (i.e., the Great Pyramid of Giz) between 2560–2540 BC.

* Nothern Europe: still in the stone age (ended between 8700 - 2000 BCE)
* Greece:
  * Archaic Greece (800 BC – 480 BC) 
  * Classical Greece (480 BC – 323 BC) - Herodotus visits Egypt and describes it's geography, people, and recounts a few semi-mythical stories.
  * Hellenistic Greece (323 BC – 146 BC)
* Rome: Founding of Rome 753 BC
* Assyrian 2500 - 609 BC

## Nabta Playa, Calendars, and Papyrus and Lotus 

1. **8000 BCE**: Sahara wasn't always aird and parched: [Nabta Playa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa#/media/File:Nabta-Egypt_NL.jpg). Because of the summer monsoon, oases would form, but still 3 days without rain and the lake would dry up.
1. **5500-5000 BCE**: First ever calendar is created in the desert to predict the beginning of summer and the rainy season! 2000 years before Stonehenge (3100 BC).
1. **5000 BCE**: People of the desert migrated to Nile as oases like Nabta Playa dried up.  The Nile Was a blessing and curse: floods and droughts.  Egyptians created the calendar we used to day: with 4 seasons!  **But** they used it to watch the Nile not the weather.
1. **4000 BCE**: as the people from the oases such as Nabta Playa finally settle, the beginnings of civilization appear: pottery, drawings et cetera.
1. **4000-3000 BCE**: two kingdoms appear: Papyrus Plant (Lower Egypt - the delta) and Lotus (Upper Egypt - "start" of the Nile)
1. **3500-3200 BCE**: 2 Kingdoms:
  * The first city of Egypt: **Hierakonpolis** - city of the Hawk (i.e., [Nekhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhen)) on the Nile and one of the most important.
  * The kingdom of Lower Egypt: **[Buto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buto)**.  Residents were less sophisticated.  This is demonstrated by the kilns and pottery.
1. **3200 BCE**: Hieroglyphics. Sumarian writing only had counting, at this time Egyptians had more complex writings.
1. **3100 BCE**: The first pharaoh, King Narmer, began unifying Lower and Upper Egypt: the founder of the first dynasty. Pharaohs of the first dynasty were buried in [Abydos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt).  The capital was [Thinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinis)
1. **3100 BCE**: King Narmer Founding of Memphis for a new capital. Memphis comes from [Menes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes).
