# Egypt

Cleopatra who ruled Egypt in the first centry BCE, is closer to us today, then the pharoahs who built the pyramids!

When Herodotus visited Egypt, the Egyptians already consider themselves ancient - they had their own archeologists!

* It is on the walls of tombs: So the gods know what the afterlife should be like - enjoy fishing for instance
* Art show the peoples' fears.

## Gods and Godesses (Pharaoh is Horus on Earth)
[Osiris myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth) Osiris is the first to rise from the dead.
![15 Major Ancient Egyptian Gods And Godesses](/images/15-ancient-egyptian-gods-facts-min.jpg)
* [Horus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus)/Falcon on Earth (Narmar Pallet). Horus was the son of Osiris who revenged the death of Isis against Set. GOD-KING! (Plato: it is the best to have a philosopher king)
* July: The gods around Aswan turn the Nile river red (setiment) and then green (vegitation)
* [Anubis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubis)/Jackel (jackels are always wondering around decaying meat) The god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.

### Myth of Osiris
* [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth)
* Born in Egypt - never conquer
* Must be whole - complete (first prostetic legs)
* Fit perfectly in coffin

### Horus vs Chaos (Climate)
Why Egypt viewed the world as so chaotic and climate was central to Egyptian culture
  * Unpredictableness of the Nile
  * Isolated by desert

Order (Ma'at), not Chaos was the will of the gods.

The living god was the early manifestation of **Horus**, a hawk, while **Seth** was the harbinger of Chaos.

Pharaohs needed to talk to the gods in order to keep **ma'at** (i.e., order).  There were man threats from flash floods (World's oldest dam at [Wadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadd_el-Kafara)), drought, sand, neighbors, and **death**.

## Nabta Playa, Calendars, and Papyrus and Lotus 

1. [Ra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra) came out of the ocean of chaos on a **mound** (i.e., pyramids!) to give life and hope.  But every night Ra goes back into the chaos only to rise again - the hope of Egyptians to be swept into the cycle of eternal life!
1. **8000 BCE**: Sahara wasn't always aird and parched: [Nabta Playa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa#/media/File:Nabta-Egypt_NL.jpg). Because of the summer monsoon, oases would form, but still 3 days without rain and the lake would dry up.
1. **5500-5000 BCE**: First ever calendar is created in the desert to predict the beginning of summer and the rainy season! 2000 years before Stonehenge (3100 BC).
1. **5000 BCE**: People of the desert migrated to Nile as oases like Nabta Playa dried up.  The Nile Was a blessing and curse: floods and droughts.  Egyptians created the calendar we used to day: with 4 seasons!  **But** they used it to watch the Nile not the weather.
1. **4000 BCE**: as the people from the oases such as Nabta Playa finally settle, the beginnings of civilization appear: pottery, drawings et cetera.
1. **4000-3000 BCE**: two kingdoms appear: Papyrus Plant (Lower Egypt - the delta) and Lotus (Upper Egypt - "start" of the Nile)
1. **3500-3200 BCE**: 2 Kingdoms:
  1. The first city of Egypt: **Hierakonpolis** - city of the Hawk (i.e., **[Nekhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nekhen))** on the Nile and one of the most important.
  1. The kingdom of Lower Egypt: **[Buto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buto)**.  Residents were less sophisticated.  This is demonstrated by the kilns and pottery.
1. **3200 BCE**: Hieroglyphics. Sumarian writing only had counting, at this time Egyptians had more complex writings.
1. **3100 BCE**: The first pharaoh, **[King Narmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer)** -  began unifying Lower and Upper Egypt: the founder of the first dynasty; believed to be the same person as Menes. Pharaohs of the first dynasty were buried in [Abydos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt).  The capital was [Thinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinis).
1. **3100 BCE**: King Narmer Founding of Memphis for a new capital. Memphis comes from [Menes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes) which is where the name Egypt comes from.

## Pharaoh's Quest for Eternity
* Is it possible that the crown is passed from pharaoh to pharaoh - not found
* Pyramds are the vehicle to resurrection and immortality.
* Pyramids of Giza are not the only pyramids.  Pyramids dot the Nile river all the way down to [Aswan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan).

[List of Pharaohs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pharaohs)

### Early Dynastic Period

#### 1st Dynasty
* **3100 BCE** King Narmer & [Narmer Palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette) - first historical document in the world - In Cairo Museum - and carved by 2 different people. Palette was likely a cosmetic palette to anoint god. Narmer Palette displays art that will the consistent throughout history. Smitting is in this pallete for centuries (i.e., **Ramesses II** **smiting** a Nubian:
![Ramesses-II-smiting-nubian](/images/Ramesses-II-smiting-nubian.jpg)
Narmar Palette lays the foundation for a god-king; i.e., a pharaoh.

#### 2nd Dynasty (Walls, Tombs, and Mastabas)
1. **2780 BCE** King Khasekhemwy. Last king of the 2nd dynasty and known for the [Tomb](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html) of [Khasekhemwy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khasekhemwy) buried near **Abydos**.  He undertook considerable building projects upon the reunification of Egypt after a period of trouble. [Built buildings out of **brick**! Recessed walls make it look beautiful with the sun moving across the sky](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/science/09egypt.html)!

### Old Kingdom

#### 3rd Dynasty (Step Pyramids)
1. 2500 BCE the great enclosure near the pyramid of Djoser - just huge! And predates Djoser by 25 years!  Oldest monumental structure created entirley of stone.
1. **2667–2648 BC**: The [Pyramid of Djoser (Imhotep)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Djoser)) - [Step Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_pyramid) for King Djoser at Saqqara - 141 ft. Djoser buried Khasekhemwy!  Djoser was Khasekhemwy's step-son.  Djoser combined the tomb/enclosure walls of Khasekhemwy but made the **mastabas** higher and higher to be visible: The step pyramid. A staircase to heaven: Commissioned the first Pyramid in Egypt.
1. Following Pharaoh had an unfinished tomb, but it was decoy.
1. **2637–2613 BCE** Pharaoh Huni the False Pyramid. The first and last step pyramid after Djoser. - 213 (ruined) - 301 ft tall. Built by last Pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty: Huni.  But Sneferu was behind the idea.

#### 4th Dynasty (Traditional Pyramids)
1. **2600 BC** [Sneferu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneferu) - Egypt's greatest pyramid builder. Inovator & and the circle! Build monements after Djoser in Dahshur.
  * [Hetepheres I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetepheres_I) was wife of Sneferu and mother of [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu).
  * [Meidum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meidum) Pyramid - more of a tower then pyramid.  In the city of Meidum
  * The [Bent Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Pyramid).  Would have been taller than pyramids of Giza.  The bent pryamid was built on sandy ground and began to crack - it had to be abandoned.
  * **2600+ BCE** [Red Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Pyramid): 45 degrees - the same as the Bent Pyramid's bent part - (344 ft). Rooms inside resemble a double pyramid to support - increase changes to go to haven. 17 years from the bricks!
1. **2580–2560 BCE** [Khufu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khufu) [Great Pyramid of Giza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza) - 455 ft.  During **Inundation** - the flooding is when the farmers worked on the pyramids.
1. **2570 BCE** [Pyramid of Khafre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Khafre) (2 feet smaller and better preserved) - causeway to the Nile: the **Sphix**. A bit of limestone is still at the top.
1. Menkaure: 3rd and smallest pyramid.
1. Shepseskaf: moves awyay from the Giza plateau.  Goes back to Saqqara and builds a mastaba: Owner of the Mastabat el-Fara'un.

Forgotten Pyramids

#### 5th Dynasty (`-Re`; Time not so kind to these pyramids - Sun king and Userkaf!)
1. [Westcar_Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westcar_Papyrus) tells the story of the beginning of dynasty 5.  Magician talks about the birth of the dynasty. **Solar kings - solar temple!**
1. [Sun Temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sun_temple)
1. **2498–2491 BCE**: [Userkaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userkaf). Built the "Heap of Stone" pyramid at [Saqqara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Userkaf). First Solar pyramid.
1. The rest of these pharaohs incorportate 'Re' into them (i.e., Sahure, Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre)
1. [Neferefre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neferefre): incomplete pyramid but a vast amount of 5th dynasty items. If tomb found, he would be the oldest intact mummy ever found.  Details records of 200 years of the king's cult festivals and honoring rituals
1. **2360 BCE**: [Unas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unas). The last of pharaohs in the 5th Dynasty [Pyramid of Unas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Unas) - Originally reaching 141 ft - now it is ruined. Pyramid Texts! So artistic and spells. They describe priests coming to power!

-- Pyramids went underground except for the Kingdom of Kush in modern day Sudan. Egypt coveted the wealth of **Nubia** 1400 BCE -- [Jebel Barkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal)

#### 6th Dynasty (Teti & Mereruka)
1. Small affairs, nothing crazy. Small pyramids.
1. First ruler: [Teti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teti) and noble around it is beautiful!
  * [Mereruka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereruka) was one of Egypt's most powerful officials at a time when the influence of local state noblemen was increasing in wealth and power. The mastaba of Mereruka is the largest and most elaborate of all the non-royal tombs in Saqqara with 33 rooms or chambers in total.
1. Last/nearly last rule: [Pepi II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepi_II_Neferkare): Possibly the longest reigning monarch of human history with 94 years on the throne. Alternatively, may have reigned "only" 64 years. Lived to be 98!
  * Maybe he lived too long or they stopped building pyramids (that is what maybe pries said): Leading to first Intermediate period.

### First Intermediate Period

#### 11th Dynasty (`-Intef`)
* Thebian monarchs trying to gain power & trying to **unify** upper and lower.
* Sehertawy Intef I was the first.  Thought of himself as a unifying ruler and king of upper and lower, but not really.
* Wahankh Intef II was the second and conquered Abydos and its nome.  He loved **dogs**.
* Nakhtnebtepnefer. `-Nefer` means **beautiful**.  Think of [Nefertari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertari). Nakhtnebtepnefer is **actually** fighting and unifying.

### Middle Kingdom (11th & 12th Dynasty & Deir el-Bahari)

#### 11th Dynasty (`-Mentu` & `-Hotep`) Continued...
* `-Mentu` (God of War) & `-Hotep` (to be pleased). This family knows you have to be tough to unify (**Amunhotep**: `Amun` is `pleased`)
* The scultpures/artists at this time had lost their skills becuase of the 1st Intermediate Period, but the `-Menut` are pulling it together.
* [Mentuhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II): **Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II** unified all Egypt c. 2015 BC, Middle Kingdom begins. 2060–2010 BC. Temple is at [Deir el-Bahari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Bahari) (the first there; later Hatshepsut’s Temple is built there).  Tomb is nice, but the artists have to get their skills back.
* Simple coffin - wooden box - **BUT** with spells.  The priests are so much more powerful - remember Unas w/ the Pyramid Texts.  After the raidings of pyramids, the common person now wants coffin texts b/c they don't have pyramids. The body shaped coffin is of the New Kingdom.
* In 1911 [Winlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Eustis_Winlock)  began excavating the mortuary complex of the 11th Dynasty pharaoh Mentuhotep II (2010–1998 B.C.) at Deir el-Bahri in the Valley of the Kings, where he discovered the bodies of 60 soldiers slain in battle and buried in linen shrouds decorated with the cartouche of Pharaoh [Mentuhotep II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentuhotep_II). On March 17, 1920 Winlock discovered the tomb of Mentuhotep II's prime minister [Meketre](https://www.metmuseum.org/met-around-the-world/?page=10157), which contains a model bakery-brewery.  There is a shoulder in the NYC Metropolitan of art. At this time lots of the material was sent back to Metropolitan Museum of Art.

#### 12th Dynasty

* [Amenemhet I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenemhat_I) I: probably a viceroy. However, produces a legend on a papyrus. And we will have a **rebirth**. Moves the capital to show Egypt is unified.  New survey the land b/c of the inundation!  People have land!  Good old days and now he has a [pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Amenemhet_I).  He is likely murdered, but he was prepared because he had his son become co-regent. Leaves note that gives advice to son to be cautious. This family used media well in order to say about how is father was "almost killed".  Could be murdered b/c he was God.
![AmenemhetIPyramid](/images/AmenemhetIPyramid.jpg)

* [Senusret I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusret_I) son of Amenemhet. He builds forts to mind gold. He goes beyond Aswan where the boulders are build huge forts. [Buhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buhen) & [Semna (Nubia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semna_(Nubia)) made of wood and mud.  He also took son as co-regent.
![Buhen](/images/Buhen3.jpg)
![Semna](/images/Semna-vue.jpg)

Then Amenemhet II (goes to Punt) and then Senusret II

### Second Intermediate Period (Hyksos & Joseph)

### New Kingdom

#### 18th Dynasty (Thebes - Pyramid-shaped mountain - Valley of the Kings)
1. **1500 BCE** [Thutmose_I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_I) designed by architect [Ineni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineni)
1. **1500 BCE** [Thutmose_III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose_III) Conquered Nubia (west Nile) and the Kingdom of Kush (East Nile).  They were the the gate keepers to the heart of Africa.

1. [Jebel Barkal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Barkal) rock formation had a strange additional rock formation that looked like the cobra and white crown/hat of the south that Egyptian's ware. Kushite rulers became pharoahs. Create 200 pyramids - more than in all of Egypt.  Smaller and steeper wuht flat tops. [Meroë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mero%C3%AB)

## Age of Gold
1. **1327 BCE** Death of Tutankhamun.  The mask that covers his face is considered the most beautiful works of art ever crafted in gold.

## Manetho

Manetho was an Egyptian chronologist.  Came up with 30 dynasties

1. Earliest known temple in is in 
1. Spirits of the dead ruled before.
1. King Menes - found Egypts first dynasty (3100 BCE) (carried off by a Hipo - WTF?)
